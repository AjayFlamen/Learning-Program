## Human Activity Recognition Using Accelerometer Data

Dataset Link: http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php

The WISDM dataset contains six different labels (Downstairs, Jogging, Sitting, Standing, Upstairs, Walking). 

## Project Overview

The availability of affordable wearable equipments and portable computing devices results in behemoth amount of data being collected including motion, location, physiological signals and environmental information. The human activity recognition (HAR) is an active research field to understand how human behaviours are developed by interpreting attributes derived from this data. “This field is the first component (sensing) of the sequence for achieving Smarter Interactive Cognitive Environments together with data analysis, decision making and taking action, and our subject of research.”[1] HAR is especially appealing to healthcare applications, such as caring and monitoring for elderly people. For example, physiological signals could be an indicator of a health condition via a change in heart rate and body temperature. We also consider accurately solving HAR problems can provide some indirect assistance to solve the motion sickness problem in VR by classifying human movements accurately and assisting real time re-calibration adjustments in VR visions.

## Problem Statement
As stated above, this paper addresses the HAR problem. The availability of affordable wearable devices, such as smart phones, enables mass data collection from users thanks to the embedded inertial sensors. Sensor signals from accelerometer, heart rate monitors, thermometers and gyroscopes are physiological signals data collected from these devices attached to human bodies. With the availability of data, analyses can be done to better recognise, classify, cluster and predict what human activities are carried out (e.g. stand, sit, lie, walk) for further decision making. Several papers already exploited this area, using supervised and semi-supervised learning methods such as support vector machine, ensemble methods with boosting and, deep learning techniques such as artificial neural network
